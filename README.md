# CIDM-6330: The Final Project

#### Project repository for CIDM-6330 Spring 2023 Final Project. 

### Problem Identification:
###### The problem I hope to address in creating a Health Journal App, an all in one medical app/system connected to each person's primary healthcare provider and collecting daily data on the user. I have attached my explanation of the nature of the problem and why a developed software system is suited to address this problem in this repository titled [EmilyVue_Problem_Identification]. 

### Domain Modeling: 
###### I have also attached my domain model which will describe the entities (nouns), associations, transactions (verbs) that captures the business rules that establish the value and integrity of the system.
