# CIDM_6330_Final_Project

### Project repository for CIDM-6330 Spring 2023 Final Project. 

### Problem Identification:
##### The problem I hope to address in creating a Health Journal App, an all in one medical app/system connected to each person's primary healthcare provider and collecting daily data on the user. I have attached my explanation of the nature of the problem and why a developed software system is suited to address this problem in this repository titled "EmilyVue_Problem_Identification". 

### Domain Modeling: 
##### I have also attached my domain model which will describe the entities (nouns), associations, transactions (verbs) that captures the business rules that establish the value and integrity of the system. Pleae find this file in  this repository titled "Final Project.drawnio.pdf".
